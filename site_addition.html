	<h2>Addition</h2>

	<p>Addition is commonly used by rich people who have a lot of <b>money</b>. Sometimes, just counting each cent isn't time-efficient. It took too long to count how much money one had. To combat this, rich people devloped an efficient and revolutionary system of counting called <b>addition</b>.</p>

	<p>Say you had two oranges in one hand and two hundred nineteen apples in another. If you were asked to find the total number of fruits you've been holding without knowing how to add, you would've been at a loss. It would take too long to count two hundred nineteen times forward from two.</p>

	<p>Rich people had the genius idea to split the numbers into digits and align them vertically, so that each place value lined up with the corresponding place value of the other numbers. By doing this, they counted with not singular units, but with integer multiples of powers of ten. However. the integer they multiplied the power of ten with had to be between zero and nine, inclusive. Otherwise, there could be more than one way to express the same number. Because of this, if you add two digits with the same place value and the sum is greater than nine, you have to subtract ten from it and add one to the place value to the left of it. This is colloquially known as "<b>carrying over</b>." By doing this, every place value has a single digit, giving every number a unique base 10 expression.</p>
