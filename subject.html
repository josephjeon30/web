	<h2>Addition</h2>

	<p>Addition is commonly used by rich people who have a lot of <b>money</b>. Sometimes, just counting each cent isn't time-efficient. It took too long to count how much money one had. To combat this, rich people devloped an efficient and revolutionary system of counting called <b>addition</b>.</p>

	<p>Say you had two oranges in one hand and two hundred nineteen apples in another. If you were asked to find the total number of fruits you've been holding without knowing how to add, you would've been at a loss. It would take too long to count two hundred nineteen times forward from two.</p>

	<p>Rich people had the genius idea to split the numbers into digits and align them vertically, so that each place value lined up with the corresponding place value of the other numbers. By doing this, they counted with not singular units, but with integer multiples of powers of ten. However. the integer they multiplied the power of ten with had to be between zero and nine, inclusive. Otherwise, there could be more than one way to express the same number. Because of this, if you add two digits with the same place value and the sum is greater than nine, you have to subtract ten from it and add one to the place value to the left of it. This is colloquially known as "<b>carrying over</b>." By doing this, every place value has a single digit, giving every number a unique base 10 expression.</p>

	<h2>Subtraction</h2>

	<p>As amazing rich people are for creating the system of addition, poor people also contributed to the mathematical findings by creating the system of subtraction. Like how rich people used addition to quickly count how much money they gained, poor people used subtraction to quickly count how much money they lose.</p>

	<p>Subtraction is like addition, but backwards. You start by taking away the bottom number's digit from the top digit's, and continue on to the left until there are no more digits left. However, in the case that the digit in the bottom is greater than the one in the top, we subtract 1 from the top digit's left and add ten to the first top digit. If it is not possible to subtract 1 from the top digit's left, then borrow one from the digit to the left of that one, and continue.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, the value you used to subtract from the other value is greater. The difference is then written as the difference the expression would have if it was reversed, but with a minus sign in front of it, to indicate that it is less than zero.</p>

	<p>If the value the rich people asked from the poor people was greater than what they had, the poor people would have negative money, which is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp"><b>debt</b></a>.</p>

	<h2>Multiplication</h2>

	<p>To get even more money, rich people developed a system called <b>multiplication</b>, which is used to tax poor people efficiently.</p>

	<p>If one desired to charge six dollars from twenty one people, it would be time-consuming to find how much money the total amount would be with just addition. So the method of repeated addition was condensed into a process called multiplication.</p>

	<p>To learn multiplication, you first need to memorize this <a href="https://multiplicationtable.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1x15-table.png">multiplication table.</a> Once you've done this, you can start multiplying. Start by multiplying the digits on the far right. If the product is greater than 9, then carry the tens digit over to the next place value, and then continue.</p>

	<h2>Division</h2>
