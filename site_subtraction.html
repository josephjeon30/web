	<h2>Subtraction</h2>

	<p>As amazing rich people are for creating the system of addition, poor people also contributed to the mathematical findings by creating the system of subtraction. Like how rich people used addition to quickly count how much money they gained, poor people used subtraction to quickly count how much money they lose.</p>

	<p>Subtraction is like addition, but backwards. You start by taking away the bottom number's digit from the top digit's, and continue on to the left until there are no more digits left. However, in the case that the digit in the bottom is greater than the one in the top, we subtract 1 from the top digit's left and add ten to the first top digit. If it is not possible to subtract 1 from the top digit's left, then borrow one from the digit to the left of that one, and continue.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, the value you used to subtract from the other value is greater. The difference is then written as the difference the expression would have if it was reversed, but with a minus sign in front of it, to indicate that it is less than zero.</p>

	<p>If the value the rich people asked from the poor people was greater than what they had, the poor people would have negative money, which is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp"><b>debt</b></a>.</p>
