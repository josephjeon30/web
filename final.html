	<h2 class="a">Project Description</h2>
	<p>This is a simulation of a battle from the game "Pokemon". The program takes inputs from the Python shell, where the inputs are used to conduct the battle in the Python Turtle Graphics window.</p>
	<h2 class="a">How it Works</h2>
	<p>There are an assortment of dictionaries that provide information for each Pokemon, including how much health it has, what type it is weak to, and more. Random Pokemon are chosen for both the player and the enemy, and the player is given a choice to which move their Pokemon plays. </p>
	<h2 class="a">Files</h2>
	<ul>

	<h2 class="a">Bugs And Things To Be Aware Of</h2>
	<p>It is suggested that the user arranges the shell window and the Python Turtle Graphics window so that both are visible at the same time.</p>
