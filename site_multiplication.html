	<h2>Multiplication</h2>

	<p>To get even more money, rich people developed a system called <b>multiplication</b>, which is used to tax poor people efficiently.</p>

	<p>If one desired to charge six dollars from twenty one people, it would be time-consuming to find how much money the total amount would be with just addition. So the method of repeated addition was condensed into a process called multiplication.</p>

	<p>To learn multiplication, you first need to memorize this <a href="https://multiplicationtable.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1x15-table.png">multiplication table.</a> Once you've done this, you can start multiplying. Start by multiplying the digits on the far right. If the product is greater than 9, then carry the tens digit over to the next place value, and then continue.</p>
